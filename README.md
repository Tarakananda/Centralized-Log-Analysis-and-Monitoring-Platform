Centralized Log Analysis and Monitoring Platform
The Centralized Log Analysis and Monitoring Platform is a project aimed at building a comprehensive DevOps solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing logs from multiple servers. The platform utilizes various tools and technologies, such as AWS, Linux, Git, Jenkins, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, and Grafana. It provides real-time monitoring and generates actionable insights for system administrators.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

docker-compose-elk.yml: Docker Compose file for deploying the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) containers.
playbook.yml: Ansible playbook for provisioning and configuring the servers and Kubernetes cluster.
logstash.conf: Logstash configuration file for ingesting logs from the S3 bucket.
README.md: Project documentation and instructions.
Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create EC2 instances, VPC configurations, S3 buckets, etc.
An SSH key pair for accessing the EC2 instance.
Basic knowledge of Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps concepts.
Deployment Instructions
Follow the step-by-step instructions below to deploy the Centralized Log Analysis and Monitoring Platform:

Set up the AWS infrastructure, including VPC, EC2 instances, and networking configurations.
Configure the Linux-based server and install Docker and Git.
Clone the project repository using git clone <REPO_URL>.
Build Docker images for each platform component using the docker build command.
Deploy the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm init and configure access with kubeconfig.
Use Ansible to provision and configure servers and the Kubernetes cluster using the ansible-playbook command.
Deploy the ELK Stack containers using Docker Compose with docker-compose -f docker-compose-elk.yml up -d.
Install Prometheus for monitoring using docker run command.
Integrate Grafana with Prometheus using docker run command.
Configure log ingestion pipeline in Logstash (logstash.conf) to retrieve logs from the S3 bucket.
Access Grafana in your browser at http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:3000 and configure dashboards and visualizations.
Please refer to the detailed Project Documentation for more information on each step and additional configuration details.
